## Running instructions

### Combined launcher (topside + bottomside)
- Use `./setup_terminals_all.sh` to run both launcher scripts:
    - `setup_terminals_topside.sh`
    - `setup_terminals_bottomside.sh`
- Flags:
    - `-d`: skip build in both scripts
- Bottomside is always run over SSH (`-s`) when using this combined script.

Examples:
- `./setup_terminals_all.sh`
- `./setup_terminals_all.sh -d`

### How to run EVERYTHING:
- colcon build (on both remote and nano)
- Every terminal:
    - srcvenv
        - source ~/nuwave-rov/venv/bin/activate
    - source install/setup.bash
- Unique terminals on remote laptop:
    - ros2 launch houston_pkg joystick_launch.launch.py
        - Launches 2 joystick nodes
    - ros2 run houston_pkg houston
    - ros2 run controller thruster_controller_node
    - ros2 run arm_controller arm_controller_node
- Unique terminals on the nano:
    - ros2 launch thruster_pkg multi_thruster.launch.py
    - ros2 launch thruster_pkg multi_arm_motor.launch.py
    - ros2 launch power_monitor_pkg multi_power_monitor.launch.py
